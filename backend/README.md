# ♟️ Vasco Backend Challenge

Welcome to Vasco's backend challenge. You are tasked to implement a few [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) procedures around Vasco's business requirements, although simplified. The API will be consumed in a revenue forecast UI similar to a Google Sheet.

## Instructions

First, clone this repo (do **not** fork it).

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/vascohq/jobs
cd backend
```

Then install all required dependencies:

```zsh
yarn install
```

Solve the levels in ascending order by writing code that makes each `level.test.ts` pass.

```zsh
yarn workspace level1 test
```

When you are done, see how to submit your challenge on the main [README](../README.md#sending-your-results).

## Pointers

The challenge is separated in levels and they become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements.

- A good way to solve this is by writing [Clean Code](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29), adding new layers of abstraction when they become necessary and possibly write tests so you don't break what you have already done.
- Don't hesitate to write shameless code at first, and then refactor it in the next levels.
- For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is clean, extensible and robust, so don't overlook edge cases, use exceptions where needed.
- Organize code and files as it was a big production application

## Data

All levels shares the same data: `data/targets.json`. Use it as you see fit to complete each level.
