# Vasco Technical Challenges

Welcome to Vasco's technical challenges! These challenges are designed to help us evaluate your technical skills and problem-solving abilities. We're looking for developers who can write clean, maintainable code and think through problems carefully.

## About Vasco

Vasco is a revenue platform for B2B teams that turns messy data into clear, AI-driven insights and weekly playbooks. It aligns sales, marketing, and CS across the full customer journey—from acquisition to expansion—to drive growth with precision.

## Available Challenges

We have four different challenges available, each focusing on different aspects of software development:

| Challenge | Profile | Tech Stack | Description | Link |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------------|------|
| ♟️ | Backend | TypeScript, Node.js, tRPC | Build a robust backend API with type safety and efficient data handling | [Start →](./backend) |
| 📊 | Backend SQL | SQL | Demonstrate your database design and query optimization skills | [Start →](./backend-sql) |
| 🧩 | Frontend | TypeScript, Vite, React | Create a modern, responsive user interface with great UX | [Start →](./frontend) |
| 🤖 | AI | TypeScript, Python, MCP, ADK | Implement features for an AI assistant that provides revenue insights and generates executive reports | [Start →](./ai) |

## How to Get Started

1. Choose the challenge that best matches your skills and interests
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the challenge directory
4. Follow the instructions in the challenge's README
5. Complete the challenge within the specified timeframe

## What We're Looking For

- Clean, well-structured code
- Good documentation
- Thoughtful error handling
- Performance considerations
- Attention to detail
- Creative problem-solving

## Use of AI Development Tools

You're encouraged to use AI tools like Claude Code or Cursor to move faster at home. At Vasco, we care about code quality, clarity, and reasoning — not how you get there.

> Use AI to accelerate your work, but ensure the result reflects your own understanding and craftsmanship. We'll test that live.

Be ready to explain your choices and adapt your code **without AI** in the live session.

**Optional:** We're curious how you used AI while working on this challenge — what helped, what didn't. If you'd like, keep your prompts or spec files so we can discuss them during the live interview.

## Submitting Your Solution

Once you've completed your challenge, you can submit it in one of two ways:

1. **GitHub Repository**
   - Create a new repository with your solution
   - Make sure to include the `.git` folder
   - Share the repository link with us

2. **Email Submission**
   - Zip your solution directory (including the `.git` folder)
   - Send it to jobs@vasco.app

Please include:
- Your name and contact information
- A brief explanation of your approach
- Any assumptions you made
- Instructions for running your solution

## Next Steps

After submitting your solution, our team will review your code and get back to you within a week. If we're impressed with your work, we'll invite you for a technical interview to discuss your solution and explore potential opportunities at Vasco.
